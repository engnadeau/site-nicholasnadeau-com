      <p>
        Dr. Nicholas Nadeau is an engineer and builder focused on developing systems that respect human agency and
        enhance intelligence, whether deploying humanoid robots, designing biomedical devices for cognitive
        neuroscience, or building privacy-first AI that evolves with user data. His career spans robotics, AI, and hard
        tech. At AON3D (YC W17), he helped scale industrial 3D printers used by aerospace and defence organizations,
        with printed parts now on the ISS and the Moon. As CTO of 1X, he led the development of humanoid robots for
        real-world collaboration, B2C, and security use cases. He later founded Nadeau Innovations, a fractional CTO
        consultancy acquired by SmartOne.ai, where he served as CTO during a period of rapid AI/LLM adoption, leading
        efforts in agentic data transformation and AI infrastructure for enterprise clients. Nicholas is currently the
        Co-Founder and CTO of a stealth startup building Personal Intelligence™. The platform combines sovereign
        architecture and edge-native performance to give individuals control over their digital lives. He also
        co-founded AI Salon Montréal, a community initiative that connects Québec’s AI startups with global investors
        and ecosystem leaders. He serves on the board of Garage&Co, a Canadian innovation hub supporting hardtech
        founders across design, prototyping, and commercialization. Nicholas actively mentors through Creative
        Destruction Lab, Next AI, and Startupfest, working with early-stage founders in AI, robotics, and emerging tech.
        He holds a Ph.D. in robotics and artificial intelligence. His work is grounded in the belief that intelligent
        systems should serve people, clearly, securely, and on their own terms.
