I'm pleased to announce the launch of [Onix](https://onixai.ai/), which I co-founded as Chief Technology Officer.

## Reimagining the Digital Bargain

For decades, the prevailing model has required trading privacy for convenience, personal data for "free" services, and autonomy for functionality. Modern AI capabilities have fundamentally changed this equation.

Specialized, high-fidelity models trained on your own data and owned by you are proving to be faster, more cost-effective, and more useful than generalized, surveillance-driven alternatives. For the first time, increased privacy directly correlates with enhanced utility.

David S. Bennahum and I founded Onix to build Personal Intelligenceâ„¢ that is private, sovereign, and fundamentally human-centered, rather than Artificial Intelligence that extracts and manipulates.

Our platform ensures your data remains yours, your agents work exclusively for your benefit, and your network amplifies your intelligence without exploiting your attention.

## Launch and Vision

Onix has stepped out of stealth with our new website at [onixai.ai](https://onixai.ai/). This represents the beginning of a broader movement toward privacy-preserving, user-controlled AI systems.

At Onix, we believe intelligence should be personal rather than artificial, and that individual data should empower users rather than exploit them. This opportunity to build technology that prioritizes human agency in the age of AI represents an exciting new chapter.
