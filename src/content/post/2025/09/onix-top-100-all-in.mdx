[Onix](https://onixai.ai/) has been recognized as one of the Top 100 Canadian startups at the ALL IN conference.

## Validation of Vision

This recognition validates our commitment to building a more private, sovereign, and human-centered future for artificial intelligence. At Onix, we maintain that intelligence should be personal rather than artificial, with individual data empowering users rather than exploiting them.

The award acknowledges our approach to Personal Intelligence™ technology that prioritizes human agency and data ownership.

## Montréal Innovation Ecosystem

This recognition reflects the strength of Montréal's technology ecosystem and our team's dedication to developing privacy-preserving AI solutions. We appreciate the support from our community as we advance this vision.

The ALL IN conference provides an important platform to showcase innovations that serve individuals rather than extract from them. Additional details about our recognition are available at [onixai.ai/onix-top-100-all-in/](https://onixai.ai/onix-top-100-all-in/).
