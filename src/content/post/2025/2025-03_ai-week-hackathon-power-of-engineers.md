Nothing is more powerful than a handful of engineers and a whiteboard.

Congratulations and kudos to Antonio Spiezia and Simon Wang for organizing an incredible hackathon this past weekend, kicking off AI Week in Montreal. Pulling off events of this magnitude requires significant courage and initiative.

These community-driven initiatives are vital but rare in our ecosystem. We need more of them. I encourage fellow community leaders to organize similar events to further establish Montreal as a global tech leader.

For all engineers and developers: participating in hackathons is highly recommended. It differentiates you, accelerates your growth, and fosters creativity. The playful interaction with technology sparks the next generation of impactful ideas.

We live in an incredible era with amazing technology. Let's build together.
