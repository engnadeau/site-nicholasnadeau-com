## The Philosophical Error

Big AI has a theory: throw enough compute at the problem and intelligence emerges. Spend enough money and you'll build a moat. They've bet $400 billion on this theory in 2025 alone.

They're wrong. And I can prove it.

This year I've been building [Onix](https://www.onixai.ai/) with [David](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbennahum/), betting on a completely different architecture. One that treats human expertise as something to amplify rather than replace. One that keeps your most personal data on your device rather than routing it through someone else's servers.

The numbers say we're on the right side of history. But more importantly, the problems that actually matter to people require what we're building, not what they're building. Let me show you why.

## The Numbers

Look, I've been staring at these numbers for months. They still don't make sense.

When GPT-4 launched in March 2023, it cost $45 per million tokens. Today, you can get equivalent performance for under $1. By next year, it'll be pennies.

![Token costs declining while capex explodes](~/assets/images/post/2025/2025-12_ai-cost-divergence.png)

This isn't normal deflation. This is **10x cost reduction per year**, faster than Moore's Law ever achieved. [Stanford's 2025 AI Index](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report) and [a16z](https://a16z.com/llmflation-llm-inference-cost/) have both documented this phenomenon. For equivalent capability, AI inference costs are cratering at a rate we've never seen in computing history.

Meanwhile, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta are [collectively spending $380-405 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/31/tech-ai-google-meta-amazon-microsoft-spend.html) this year on AI infrastructure. That's up from $241 billion in 2024. [Goldman Sachs projects](https://techblog.comsoc.org/2025/11/01/ai-spending-boom-accelerates-big-tech-to-invest-invest-an-aggregate-of-400-billion-in-2025-more-in-2026/) $1.15 trillion in hyperscaler capex from 2025-2027.

![Hyperscaler capex growth trajectory](~/assets/images/post/2025/2025-12_hyperscaler-capex.png)

Here's my question: **What exactly are they buying?**

They're buying depreciating assets in an environment of unprecedented cost deflation. Every data center they build today will be economically obsolete faster than any infrastructure investment in history.

## The DeepSeek Moment

On January 27, 2025, a Chinese startup called DeepSeek released R1, a reasoning model that [matched OpenAI's best work](https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/publication/taking-stock-deepseek-shock) on critical benchmarks.

The training cost? **$5.6 million.**

For context, GPT-4 reportedly cost over $100 million to train. Google's Gemini Ultra, north of $200 million.

![DeepSeek training cost compared to competitors](~/assets/images/post/2025/2025-12_deepseek-training-cost.png)

The market lost its mind. And honestly? They were right to panic.

NVIDIA lost [$600 billion in market cap](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/27/tech/deepseek-stocks-ai-china) in a single day, the largest single-day loss in stock market history. Nearly $1 trillion in total value evaporated from US tech stocks that week.

What DeepSeek proved wasn't just that you could build frontier AI cheaper. It proved there is **no moat in raw compute**. When a team with "crippled" export-controlled GPUs can match your $100 million model for 5% of the cost, your capital expenditure isn't a competitive advantage. It's a liability.

The recovery that followed, with NVIDIA eventually hitting $5 trillion by October, doesn't change the lesson. It just shows how much the market wants to believe the old story.

## The Bubble Warning Signs

I'm not the only one saying this. [Former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/are-we-in-an-ai-bubble.html) admitted it outright: "Of course we are [in a bubble]. I mean, we're hyped, we're accelerating, we're putting enormous leverage into the system."

The indicators are everywhere:

![AI bubble warning indicators](~/assets/images/post/2025/2025-12_bubble-indicators.png)

**Free cash flow has turned negative.** Hyperscaler FCF is [set to shrink by more than 16%](https://fortune.com/2025/10/07/ai-bubble-cisco-moment-dotcom-crash-nvidia-jensen-huang-top-analyst/) over the next 12 months. They're spending faster than they can generate cash.

**Debt is exploding.** [Goldman Sachs found](https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/this-is-how-the-ai-bubble-bursts) hyperscalers took on $121 billion in new debt last year, a 300% increase from typical levels. They'd have to spend 94% of operating cash flow to pay for AI buildouts without debt financing.

**Revenue isn't keeping pace.** Capex is growing at 75% year-over-year while cloud revenue grows at 30-35%. The math doesn't work.

**Almost nobody is paying.** [Only 3% of consumers](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/23/nx-s1-5615410/ai-bubble-nvidia-openai-revenue-bust-data-centers) pay for AI services. 71% of companies use AI in some form, but meaningful monetization remains elusive.

Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu put it bluntly: ["These models are being hyped up, and we're investing more than we should."](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/23/nx-s1-5615410/ai-bubble-nvidia-openai-revenue-bust-data-centers)

## Why Small Wins

Here's the contrarian bet I'm making with [Onix](https://www.onixai.ai/): **the future of AI isn't in the cloud. It's at the edge. And it's not general-purpose. It's specialized.**

The hyperscaler thesis assumes that bigger is better. More parameters, more data, more compute. Build the biggest model and everyone will pay to access it through your API.

But that thesis has a fatal flaw: it assumes the cost advantage stays with scale. In a 10x-per-year deflationary environment, **the cost advantage moves to efficiency**.

Small, specialized models running at the edge have structural advantages that no amount of capex can overcome:

**Latency.** You can't beat physics. A model running on-device will always be faster than a round-trip to a data center. For real-time applications like robotics, autonomous systems, and interactive agents, this isn't a nice-to-have. It's table stakes.

**Privacy.** Enterprises are [increasingly skeptical](https://www.ibm.com/think/news/2025-open-ai-trends) of sending their data to cloud providers. When your model runs locally, your data never leaves. That's not a feature. It's a requirement for regulated industries.

**Cost at scale.** When inference costs drop 10x per year, the expensive part isn't the model. It's the infrastructure to serve it. Edge deployment eliminates that entirely. Your users' devices become your compute infrastructure.

**Specialization beats generalization.** A 7B parameter model fine-tuned for your specific domain will outperform a 400B general-purpose model on your actual use case. And it'll run on a laptop.

The open-source ecosystem has already figured this out. [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/), [Llama](https://ai.meta.com/llama/), [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/), [Phi](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/phi). The proliferation of capable small models is accelerating. By late 2025, models like DeepSeek-V3 and Llama 4 deliver [comparable performance at a fraction of the cost](https://www.wing.vc/content/open-source-versus-proprietary-ai-models-the-new-frontiers-of-ai-competition).

Even the hardware is decentralizing. [RISC-V hit 25% market penetration](https://markets.financialcontent.com/wral/article/tokenring-2025-12-26-risc-v-hits-25-market-penetration-as-qualcomm-and-meta-lead-the-shift-to-open-source-silicon) this month. Open-source silicon is eating into proprietary chip monopolies the same way open-source models are eating into proprietary AI.

## The Enterprise Reality Check

Here's something the hyperscaler pitch decks don't mention: most enterprises that actually deploy AI at scale are discovering that the cloud-first model doesn't work for their most valuable use cases.

I've talked to manufacturing companies that need sub-10ms inference for quality control. Healthcare organizations that legally cannot send patient data to external servers. Financial services firms where every API call represents latency their trading systems can't afford.

For these organizations, the hyperscaler value proposition is backwards. They don't need access to the biggest model. They need the right model, running where their data lives, with guarantees about privacy and performance that no cloud provider can offer.

The irony is that as models get smaller and more efficient, the case for centralized cloud inference gets weaker, not stronger. Two years ago, you needed a data center to run anything useful. Today, a fine-tuned 7B model running on a laptop can outperform GPT-3 on domain-specific tasks. Next year, that same laptop will run models that outperform today's GPT-4 on those tasks.

The hyperscalers are building for a world where capability requires scale. But we're entering a world where capability is democratized and deployment flexibility becomes the differentiator.

## The Problems That Actually Matter

Here's what gets lost in the infrastructure debate: there's a category of problem that matters more than anything else. Problems that are complex, deeply personal, and high stakes.

Think about the wicked problems in people's lives. Managing a chronic illness across multiple specialists who don't talk to each other. Navigating complex family finances across generations. Coordinating care for aging parents while raising kids. Going through a career transition that requires understanding who you really are.

These problems require context. Real, vulnerable, personal context. And that context requires trust.

You want to solve someone's health problem? They need to tell you everything. Their symptoms, their history, their fears, their family situation. You think they're sharing that with ChatGPT? With a company that's training on their data? Of course not.

This is the gap. The problems that matter most require the one thing Big AI structurally cannot provide: privacy that enables trust that enables context that enables real solutions.

The hyperscalers can spend another trillion dollars. They still won't solve this.

And here's what excites me even more: the best practitioners I know are maxed out. The doctors, the coaches, the advisors, the therapists. They can only see so many patients, coach so many clients, advise so many students. Their expertise is trapped in their calendar.

What if it wasn't? What if AI could amplify their genius instead of trying to replace it?

That's not a cloud API play. That's edge-deployed, privacy-native AI that keeps personal context where it belongs while extending the reach of people who've spent their lives mastering their craft.

The $400 billion bet assumes AI is a service you access. The future I'm building toward assumes AI is a capability you own, powered by expertise you trust.

## The Structural Gift

Here's what the hyperscalers don't want to admit: their biggest investment is becoming their biggest vulnerability.

When you've spent $400 billion on centralized infrastructure, you can't pivot to edge. When your business model depends on API calls to your data centers, you can't embrace on-device deployment. When your moat is supposed to be compute scale, you can't acknowledge that a $5.6 million training run can match your $100 million one.

The sunk costs lock them in. The organizational structure locks them in. The Wall Street expectations lock them in.

This is the structural gift to everyone building decentralized, edge-deployed, specialized AI. The giants are trapped fighting yesterday's war while the battlefield shifts underneath them.

![AI cost deflation vs Moore's Law](~/assets/images/post/2025/2025-12_ai-vs-moores-law.png)

At this rate of deflation, the question isn't whether small models will be "good enough." By 2027, small specialized models will be better than today's frontier models while running on hardware that costs a fraction of current cloud inference.

## The Bet I'm Making

This is why we're building [Onix](https://www.onixai.ai/) the way we are. Edge-first. Privacy-native. Human expertise at the center.

When David and I started this journey at the beginning of 2025, we made a deliberate choice to bet against the consensus. The consensus said you need massive compute. The consensus said you need to build on top of the hyperscaler APIs. The consensus said small players can't compete with companies spending hundreds of billions.

We looked at the same data I've shared in this post and saw something different. We saw a window to build AI that actually empowers people instead of extracting from them.

I'm not saying the hyperscalers will fail. They have distribution, they have enterprise relationships, they have more cash than most countries' GDP. They'll survive.

But the returns on that $400 billion? The moat they think they're building? That's the bubble.

The real opportunity is in the gap between their spending and the collapsing costs. Every dollar they pour into centralized infrastructure is a dollar that becomes less valuable as inference costs drop another 10x. And every problem they can't solve because of their architecture becomes an opportunity for those of us building differently.

## For Builders

If you're a founder building in AI right now, this is the moment to pay attention.

The giants are overcommitted to a strategy that cost deflation is systematically undermining. The tools to compete with them are becoming commoditized. The models are open-sourcing faster than anyone predicted. The edge is wide open.

You don't need $100 million to train a frontier model anymore. You don't need to rent GPU clusters from hyperscalers to serve your customers. You don't need to accept their terms on data privacy and vendor lock-in.

What you need is focus. Pick a domain. Build something specialized. Deploy it where the data lives. Optimize for efficiency instead of scale.

## The Real Mistake

The $400 billion mistake isn't just bad capital allocation. It's a philosophical error.

They're building AI that treats human intelligence as a problem to be solved. We're building AI that treats human intelligence as something to be amplified.

I believe the best AI extends human expertise rather than trying to replace it. I believe the problems that matter most require trust, and trust requires privacy. I believe the practitioners who've spent their lives mastering their craft deserve tools that extend their reach, not tools that render them obsolete.

Small models. Edge deployment. Human expertise amplified.

That's the bet. That's what we're building with Onix. And if you're a builder who believes the same thing, I'd love to hear from you.
