The inaugural AI Salon Montreal was a resounding success, showcasing the passion, talent, and drive of Montreal's extraordinary AI community.

Bringing together founders, investors, builders, and thought leaders proved again that this city is an AI innovation powerhouse. Our mission is clear: connect local startups with VC funding and bridge the gap for early-stage companies.

The energy was high, featuring a keynote from Jean-Simon Venne and impressive pitches from:
- Patrick Murphy (Maket)
- Gabriel Lespérance (Trampoline AI)
- Katya Shabanova (crbnx inc.)

We're already seeing momentum, with Maket recently securing investment from Reid Hoffman and Blitzscaling Ventures!

Huge thanks to our sponsors, partners, and the incredible team:
- Champion Sponsor: Fasken (Adam Saskin)
- Core Sponsors: GuruLink, Amazon, Montréal International
- Community & Logistics Partners: Fulko Films, NEXT AI, CDL-Montreal, ELANTech, IVADO, CEIM, Inovia Capital, Front Row Ventures, Jeffrey D. Abbott & the global AI Salon team, Innovobot (Michel Dubois), Constance Jaluzot & volunteers.
- Co-founders: Claude G. Théoret, Sylvain Carle.

This is just the beginning. Montreal deserves a prominent place on the global AI stage, and together, we're building it.
