I am pleased to announce my appointment as President of the Board at [Garage&Co](https://en.garageincubation.com/).

## Advancing Hardtech Innovation

Garage&Co supports entrepreneurs who develop physical innovations that address society's most complex challenges, facilitating their progression from prototype to market-ready solutions.

Our objective is to establish Québec and Canada as global leaders in hardtech innovation by accelerating the path from concept to commercialization.

## Strategic Leadership

I look forward to working with [Laurence Audette-Lagueux](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurence-audette-lagueux/) and the broader Garage&Co community, including Christian Beaubien, to advance this mission.

## Relevant Experience

As highlighted in [Garage&Co's announcement](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/garageincubateur_garageincubation-gouvernance-hardtech-activity-7366875978754654208-MR67), my background in hardtech entrepreneurship and artificial intelligence aligns with the organization's strategic focus.

This includes experience from AON3D (YC W17), where I contributed to industrial 3D printing technology deployed to the International Space Station and lunar missions, through my role as CTO at 1X for humanoid robotics, to co-founding a Personal Intelligence™ company and founding Nadeau Innovations, which was acquired by SmartOne.ai.

I have also been involved in ecosystem development as co-founder of AI Salon Montréal and mentor with CDL-Montreal, NEXT AI, and Startupfest.

At Garage&Co, we maintain that significant innovations emerge from strategic governance and collaborative vision. This appointment represents an opportunity to contribute to Canada's leadership in the hardtech sector.
