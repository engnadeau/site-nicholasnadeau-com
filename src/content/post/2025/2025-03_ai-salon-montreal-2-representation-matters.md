AI Salon Montreal's second event successfully brought together founders, investors, and builders, deepening our community's focus on impactful AI through representation.

We championed Women in AI, highlighted by Cassie Rheaume's powerful keynote urging us to value, listen, act, support, invest, and persist for inclusive AI development. If AI is a promise, all voices must deliver it.

Impressive startup pitches featured:

- Adrienne Jung (eeva): Helping Gen Z master adulting with AI.
- Laila Mahmoudi (PhantasiAI): Transforming neurostimulation recovery.
- Andy Mauro (Storycraft): Turning players into creators with social AI.

Huge thanks to our sponsors and partners:

- Champions: Innoprofits, Fasken
- Core: GuruLink, Amazon, Montréal International
- Partners: Fulko Films, NEXT AI, CDL-Montreal, ELANTech, IVADO, CEIM, Inovia Capital, Front Row Ventures

Kudos to my co-founders Claude G. Théoret, Sylvain Carle, Innovobot, and the driving force of Michel Dubois and Constance Jaluzot.

We're building Montreal's AI future, together.
