Returning as a mentor at [Startupfest 2025](https://www.startupfest.com/speakers-and-mentors), where Montreal transforms into Canada's startup capital from July 9-11. This year's event brings together founders, investors, and builders pushing real technology forward.

## Mentorship Focus: Ambitious Builders Welcome

Startupfest provides a unique opportunity to connect with founders tackling significant challenges. The mentorship sessions focus on delivering direct, actionable feedback to entrepreneurs building scalable technology solutions.

### What to Expect

- **Direct Feedback**: Honest assessments of business models, technology choices, and market positioning
- **Technical Guidance**: Insights on AI implementation, product development, and scaling challenges
- **Strategic Conversations**: Discussion of funding strategies, team building, and market entry approaches
- **Network Connections**: Introductions to relevant investors, partners, and technical talent

## Montreal's Startup Ecosystem in Action

Startupfest showcases Montreal's position as a leading technology hub, particularly in AI, robotics, and deep tech innovation. The event creates a concentrated environment where meaningful connections form between experienced operators and emerging founders.

The three-day format allows for extended conversations beyond typical networking events, enabling deeper exploration of complex technical and business challenges.

## Building Real Technology

The focus remains on supporting founders building substantial technology companies rather than lifestyle businesses. This means prioritizing discussions around:

- Scalable technical architectures
- Defensible competitive advantages
- Clear paths to significant market impact
- Strong founding team dynamics

Startupfest continues to attract serious builders committed to creating lasting value in the Canadian technology ecosystem.
