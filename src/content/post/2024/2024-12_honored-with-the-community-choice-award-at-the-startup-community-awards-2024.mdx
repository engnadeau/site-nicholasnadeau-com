Last week, I had the incredible honor of being recognized at the **Startup Community Awards 2024**, hosted by MontrÃ©al NewTech / Ã‰lanTech in collaboration with Startupfest. While I was initially nominated for the **Tough Love Mentor of the Year**, I was surprised and deeply moved to receive the **Prix Coup de Coeur / Community Choice Award**! ðŸŽ‰

This award is especially meaningful because it reflects the appreciation of our amazing ecosystemâ€”a community I'm proud to serve and support through mentorship, collaboration, and innovation.

## Building a Community for the Future

During my acceptance speech, I shared how my passion for mentorship and community building is rooted in my desire to create an ecosystem that my son will one day be proud to inherit. Every interaction, mentorship session, and collaboration fills me with pride because I know we're collectively shaping a brighter future for MontrÃ©al's startup landscape.

## A Shoutout to the Ecosystem Heroes

A huge thank you to **NEXT AI**, **Creative Destruction Lab**, and all the platforms that have allowed me to share my passion for **emerging technologies**, **entrepreneurship**, and **mentorship**. I'm constantly inspired by the amazing mentors and peers I've had the privilege of learning from and collaborating with.

Special recognition goes to some of the startups and partners I've been fortunate to work with, including:

- **Acrylic Robotics**
- **XMachina**
- **XPR Labs Inc.**
- **BRIDGR**
- **Osedea**
- **R&D Partners**
- **Fundica**

Your drive and ingenuity remind me why this ecosystem is so special.

## Looking Ahead

Congratulations to all the other winners and nominees, including **Sylvain Carle**, who was also honored at the event. It's an immense privilege to be recognized alongside such impactful contributors to our ecosystem. I'm excited about the projects we'll build together in the coming months.

This award isn't just a recognition of my past efforts; it's a call to continue pushing forward, creating opportunities, and building connections that strengthen our ecosystem.

Let's keep building something extraordinary together! ðŸš€
