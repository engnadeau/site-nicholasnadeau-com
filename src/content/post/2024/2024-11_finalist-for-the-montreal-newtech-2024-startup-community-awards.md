I’m thrilled and honored to announce that I’ve been selected as a finalist for the **Tough Love Mentor** category at this year’s Montréal NewTech Startup Community Awards! 🎉 This award recognizes mentors who push entrepreneurs to their limits with direct, no-nonsense advice, and I’m beyond grateful to be recognized among such impactful leaders.

Being part of Montreal’s tech and startup ecosystem has been an incredible journey. Every mentorship opportunity, from **NEXT AI** to **CDL-Montreal**, has been a chance to support talented founders and help them shape their visions. Over the past year, I’ve had the privilege to work with inspiring startups like **Acrylic Robotics, OpAI Innovations, Citera, SupportX, KonnectAi, SmartOne.ai, XPR Labs Inc., Driad AI, Vope Medical, Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, Sirius Frio,** and **SmartOne.ai**. Each of these ventures, and the dedicated people behind them, has made my role as a mentor incredibly rewarding.
